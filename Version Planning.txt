ROADMAP:

1) Transport ammo containers manually
	- Force walking
	- No weapon?  Or use the drag/carry animations?
	- Only works on smaller ammo containers (no crates or caches will do)
2) FOB/PB Zones
	- Use flagpole (set nationality in a config file)
	- Creates a zone (small for PBs - 25m?  50 at most.  Larger for FOBs)
	- WITHIN the zone, you may use the construct menu (or it will enable additional features)
	- Create base functions (resting, LOGPAC, request additional soldiers/vehicles/support)
3) Enemy HQ Spawns for zones
	- Work through Stratis to begin with
4) Ambiance spawns for FOBs, PBs, and Civilian structures
5) Side mission generation
6) Movement of objects with truck transports
7) Helo taxi and marking LZs
8) Arty support
9) Ancillary patrols, checkpoints, etc.
10) Army power representation, logistics, and requirements
11) Intel, G-2, ORBAT

???) Training of units
???) Integrate the HC manager from DUWS
???) Actually use a construction cost for building items
???) Add object de-struction and recoupment cost
???) Greater diversity to friendly unit spawns - namely, vests (heavy protection - for extra cost - regular, or light - for lower cost)
???) Naming and tagging ammo containers
	- Add action menu to read tags and set tags?
	- Must prevent duplicates
???) Constructing objects at the same height as you are?  (e.g. to create objects within buildings?)
